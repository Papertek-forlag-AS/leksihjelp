# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-17)

**Core value:** Norwegian students write foreign languages better — with correct words, correct form, and confidence in pronunciation — without leaving the page they're working on.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation (Vocab Seam + Regression Fixture)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 complete (Foundation — Vocab Seam + Regression Fixture) — all 3 plans done
Plan: 3 of 3 complete in Phase 1
Status: Phase 1 complete; ready for Phase 2 (Data Layer) planning
Last activity: 2026-04-18 — Plan 01-03 complete (fixture harness + 132 ground-truth JSONL cases + CLAUDE.md release gate)

Progress: [██████████] 100%  (Phase 1, 3/3 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 11m 12s
- Total execution time: 33m 36s

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 01 | 3 | 33m 36s | 11m 12s |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 4m 24s, 13m 47s, 15m 25s
- Trend: stable at ~13–15 min per plan (complexity-driven — P01 greenfield 2-file, P02 5-file cutover, P03 harness + 132 fixture cases)

*Updated after each plan completion*

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Phase 01 P01 | 4m 24s | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 01 P02 | 13m 47s | 2 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 01-foundation-vocab-seam-regression-fixture P03 | 15m 25s | 3 tasks | 14 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Project init: Spell-check stays free forever (landing-page promise)
- Project init: Heuristics only, no ML, no paid APIs
- Project init: Iterative releases — each phase independently shippable
- Project init: NB first, NN second for spell-check; all 6 languages for word-prediction
- Project init: Regression fixture is the quality-gate tool for this milestone
- [Phase 01]: vocab-seam surface: getBigrams() returns null (not empty object) when file missing — matches existing consumer null-handling
- [Phase 01]: vocab-seam default grammar predicate when enabledGrammarFeatures storage key missing: () => true (emit superset; consumers filter further)
- [Phase 01]: typoBank is a Map reference-alias of typoFix (same Map, zero memory cost)
- [Phase 01]: Finding contract locked — core emits `rule_id` (not `type`); DOM adapter shims `f.type = f.rule_id` post-call so legacy UI code works unchanged (consumed by Plan 03 fixture harness)
- [Phase 01]: Grammar-feature filtering is seam-level only — word-prediction consumes pre-filtered wordList as-is, single source of truth
- [Phase 01]: Consumer-local derived state (prefixIndex, tense sets) rebuilt via VOCAB.onReady(cb) re-registration on LANGUAGE_CHANGED / GRAMMAR_FEATURES_CHANGED — avoids stale captures without changing the seam API
- [Phase 01]: Fixture cases are hand-authored ground truth, not snapshots of current tool output (pitfall #4) — a case that fails today because of an imperfect rule stays in the fixture; fixing the rule is what flips the exit code back to 0
- [Phase 01]: Fixture exit-code semantics — non-zero on ANY hard mismatch (missing expected OR unexpected flag); P/R/F1 printed but not thresholded in Phase 1 (thresholds deferred to Phase 4 SC-05 per CONTEXT)
- [Phase 01]: Span convention in fixtures is end-EXCLUSIVE (end = start + word.length) and fixture filenames are ASCII-only (`saerskriving.jsonl`, not `særskriving.jsonl`)
- [Phase 01]: Live Chrome smoke test for Phase 1 deferred by user on 2026-04-18 ("I can't test now, but we shouldn't let that block progress — continue and we make the tests later") — to be picked up at release time or during `/gsd:verify-work`
- [Phase 01]: Three pre-existing data-source issues surfaced during fixture authoring (NN verb-infinitive pollution `lese → lese høyt`; NB noun `brev` tagged `m` instead of `n`; typos-in-validWords bypassing curated branch) — NOT rule bugs, data quality issues in `papertek-vocabulary`; natural fit for Phase 2 DATA-02

### Pending Todos

- Live Chrome smoke test for Phase 1 (deferred 2026-04-18): load `extension/` unpacked, type `en hus` in a textarea, confirm red dot + `et hus` popover, DevTools console clean. Pick up at release time or during `/gsd:verify-work`.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 DATA-02 has cross-app blast radius — schema changes in `papertek-vocabulary` affect `papertek-webapps` and `papertek-nativeapps`; coordinate before landing.
- Phase 3 code-switching detection needs empirical calibration for Norwegian vs. close Germanic neighbors (Swedish, Danish, German) — research flag from SUMMARY.md.
- Phase 4 særskriving precision/recall thresholds depend on fixture sentences authored in Phase 1 — do not set thresholds until the fixture is in place.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-04-18 — Executed Plan 01-03 (fixture harness + 132 ground-truth JSONL cases + CLAUDE.md release gate). Phase 1 complete.
Stopped at: Completed 01-03-PLAN.md. Phase 1 (Foundation — Vocab Seam + Regression Fixture) is complete; ready for Phase 2 (Data Layer) planning.
Resume file: None — suggest `/gsd:plan-phase 2` (or `/gsd:verify-work 1` first to confirm phase health, and to pick up the deferred Chrome smoke test).
